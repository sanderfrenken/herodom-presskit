In a new take on the strategic tower defense games, Herodom combines unit, resource and city management with interactive combat elements.

Herodom offers an immersive world to explore with 20 different stages. There are 50+ unique heroes to collect and 150+ different units and siege weapons to battle with.
Moreover, you can farm more than 45 different types of crops, trees and animals and use them to prepare food for your soldiers.
Or unleash your imagination, and build your own characters using the 350+ different assets to collect during the main storyline.

Herodom is very much influenced by the art that was created for the Liberated Pixel Cup. I collaborate with artist from around the globe, and we open source the artwork as well. This enables me to interact with a lot of talented artists and keep the art affordable as well. In addition, the creative minds gathered in the community form an incredible idea generating machine.

In total, over the last one and a half year I published 35 updates, of which 6 were major versions introducing new gameplay elements including an idle farm simulation and a character generator.

Using metrics gathered during playtime, I analyze how the game is played. This enables me to efficiently use my time and resources to develop Herodom further.
Moreover, I keep a tight connection with my fanbase over socials and the AppStore itself, as the feedback I gather there is more valuable than anything else.

For the future, I have a lot on my backlog. I am frequently asked to develop a sandbox mode, or add multiplayer support. Moreover, I am designing gameplay options for crafting and more. I also envision additional campaigns or even sequels, exploring the history and future of the world through different themes including Mayan, the Wild West and SciFi.
